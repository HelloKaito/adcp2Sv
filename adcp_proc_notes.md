## Install UHDAS/CODAS system
- First follow the instructions starting from [here](http://currents.rrevelle.sio.ucsd.edu/adcp/programs/adcp_doc/codas_setup/anaconda_install/index.html) to get Anaconda set up, and download the packages specified.
- Download Mercurial [here](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download). I did it threw homebrew by `brew install mercurial`
- Continue to follow [instructions](http://currents.rrevelle.sio.ucsd.edu/adcp/programs/adcp_doc/codas_setup/codas_config/index.html) to get CODAS compiled and installed.
- I also installed the [`arlpy`](https://pypi.org/project/arlpy/) package for getting functionality to compensate for sea water absorption and transmission loss.
